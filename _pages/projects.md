## Flute Musician
'Flute Musician' was the final project for my mechatronics course (ME 4405). The motivation for this project was:
> Can we replicate the embouchure technique and
synchronize with physical key combinations to play a
flute using mechanical design and mechatronics?

There were 4 main subsystems for this robot:​
1. **Mouthpiece & Pneumatics**: provides airflow to the flute via a 3D-printed mouthpiece to produce sound. Also includes a bullet valve to replicate tongue articulation.
2. **Key Articulation**: actuate keys via cable-drive from servos to execute the correct fingerings. The servos are located on linear rails to allow for in-situ adjustment of servo positioning.
3. **Flow Control**: stepper motor adjusts flow for each note depending on pre-set, experimentally-derived steps to produce the best tone.
4. **Sensing & Feedback**: microphone monitors output frequency of the flute and executes tuning sequence.
