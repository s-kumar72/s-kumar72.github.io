Hello! My name is Sadhana, and I'm a mechanical engineering and robotics student at Georgia Tech with diverse experience across CAD applications, process design, and software development. I've interned at Apple, Timken, and NASA, developing innovative solutions in CAD tool automation, manufacturing systems, and mission concept proposals. I'm also skilled in leading cross-functional teams, technical writing, and advanced prototyping, with a strong foundation in mechanical design and programming languages. 

This website hosts my projects, conference posters and abstracts, and CV. Happy to chat at sadhana.kumar@gatech.edu!
